1.8-Models
==========

Handcrafted 1.8 block/item models (handcrafted := writting the json by hand).

This project's goal is to replace as many of the single-cube/builtin-generated models in Minecraft as possible.

"Official" channel: #think @ irc.spi.gt

Note: the sole branch (master) is bleeding edge, so don't blame me if broken stuff makes it in.

This pack does not and *will not* support Fast GFX mode.
