## About

Handcrafted 1.8 block/item models (handcrafted := writting the json by hand).
This project may potentially begin using https://github.com/MrCrayfish/ModelCreator once it's stable.

This project's goal is to replace as many of the single-cube/builtin-generated models in Minecraft as possible.

## Installation

You can clone this repo directly into your resource pack directory, or you can build a distributable zip with `./build`.

Note that `build` has some compilation flags, which are as follows:
  
  - `-noblockitems` - Disables custom icons for (most) block items, such as dirt being a sack of dirt in the inventory.

## Notes

"Official" channel: #think @ irc.spi.gt

The sole branch (master) is bleeding edge, so don't blame me if broken stuff makes it in.

This pack does not and *will not* support Fast GFX mode.

## Legal

If you wanna use my pack in a non-personal context (e.g. a creative work such as a video), read the license. A line creding me
and a link back to this repo is good enough to keep me happy.

I don't like it when people say "you can't use this without my permission!", especially about publicly distributed mods or texture packs.
Hence, I try to give the user a lot of freedom, but keeping just enough control that people won't steal my work. Pretty much the only
thing I don't want is people claiming this is their work, nor do I want it to get distributed without source (if only because I detest
reposting).
